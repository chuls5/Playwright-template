# Playwright (Node.js) Test Framework - Starter Template üöÄ

A comprehensive, enterprise-grade test automation template leveraging Playwright to ensure quality and reliability for web applications. This repository is designed to be a template for users who want to establish their own Playwright repository using Node.js and @alex_neo/azure-reporter for integration with Azure DevOps. The framework includes capabilities for requirement-based validation, regression testing, smoke testing, functional verification, and end-to-end scenarios‚Äîall configured to validate application behavior across multiple browsers, device profiles, and user journeys.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

The commands are:

- "npm --version" : To display the installation version of npm
- "git --version" : To display the installation version of git
- "git remote -v" : To verify where your local git repository is connected / pointing to

Your terminal should display the following after typing, "git remote -v".
If this is your first time here, please continue with project setup below.

origin https://github.com/chuls5/Playwright-template (fetch)
origin https://github.com/chuls5/Playwright-template (push)

## Project Setup üîß

### 1. Connect to and Clone the Repository üìÅ

Cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your machine, allowing you to use and modify the code independently of the original repository.
There are two methods to clone the repository: HTTPS (username/password) or SSH (key-based). HTTPS is the simplest for new users.

#### HTTPS Method (Recommended for New Users)

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project
3. Run the clone command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chuls5/Playwright-template
```

#### SSH Method (For Users with SSH Setup)

If you already have SSH set up with Github:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chuls5/Playwright-template.git
cd playwright-template
```

#### Verify Repository Connection

After cloning, you most likely want to set up your own Git repository for your new Playwright project. You are going to need to initilize a new git repository on your local machine. Then you wll push this repo whatever URL you want. To do this you must first make sure you are NOT connected to my (Cody's) Playwright template on Github. The commands to check & re establish your git origin are as follows:

```bash
git remote -v

git remote remove origin

git remote add origin <URL>
```

## Test Structure üß™

Tests are organized to cover core application functionality and follow best practices for maintainability and reliability:

- üîë Authentication state storage to optimize test performance
- ‚öôÔ∏è Environment configuration through dotenv
- üåê Cross-browser testing capabilities
- üìä Detailed reporting for test results analysis

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The project uses `playwright.config.js` to configure test execution. Key configuration options include:

- üåê Browsers to test (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- üì± Viewport sizes
- ‚è±Ô∏è Test timeouts
- üì∏ Screenshot and video capture settings
- ‚ö° Parallel execution options

## CI Pipeline üîÑ

The project is configured to run tests in CI using Azure DevOps Pipelines. The workflow configuration is located in `.github/workflows/`. Pipeline configurations handle:

- üîÑ Automated test runs on Pull Requests
- üìä Test report generation and publishing
- üèóÔ∏è Parallel test execution across browsers
- üîî Notification of test results

## Viewing Test Reports üìä

After running tests, HTML reports are generated that show detailed test results:

1. Run tests with the report option:

   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

2. View the generated report:
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

This will open a browser with detailed test results, including screenshots and traces for failed tests.

## Writing Tests üìù

Tests are written using Playwright's test framework. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("example test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example Domain/);
  await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Example Domain");
});
```

### Best Practices üí°

1. Use page objects to encapsulate page-specific selectors and actions
2. Organize tests by requirements, feature, or page
3. Make tests independent from each other
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Avoid hardcoded timeouts with `waitFor` functions instead
6. Use test data helpers for generating test data
